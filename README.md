UtLoader
A fast, modern YouTube downloader for Windows built with WPF + MVVM.
UtLoader is a lightweight desktop application that wraps yt‑dlp and ffmpeg inside a clean, responsive WPF interface.
It provides real‑time progress, MP3/MP4 output, post‑processing status, and a smooth user experience powered by a custom download pipeline.

🚀 Features

- File size updates
- File name detection
- Status messages:
- Downloading…
- Extracting audio…

- Finishing…
  
🧠 Smart Behavior
- Playlist detection with user confirmation
- Automatic MP3 extraction
- Automatic MP4 merging
- Error handling with clear messages
- Non‑blocking UI (async/await)
  
🧱 Clean Architecture
- Full MVVM pattern
- DownloadService handles:
- yt‑dlp execution
- ffmpeg conversion
- output parsing
- progress callbacks
- UI stays responsive and clean

🏗️ How It Works
1. User enters a YouTube URL
The ViewModel validates input and enables the Download button.

3. DownloadService launches yt‑dlp
- Standard output and error streams are parsed in real time
- Regex extracts:
- percentage
- file size
- file name
- extraction/merging steps

3. UI updates live
The ViewModel receives callbacks and updates:
- Progress
- FileName
- FileSize
- Status

4. Post‑processing
Depending on the format:
- MP3 → audio extraction
- MP4 → merging video + audio
- Optional conversion if the downloaded file is not MP4
